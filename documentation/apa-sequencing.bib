	abstract = {Aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) are the commonest curable cause of hypertension. Most have gain-of-function somatic mutations of ion channels or transporters. Herein we report the discovery, replication and phenotype of mutations in the neuronal cell adhesion gene CADM1. Independent whole exome sequencing of 40 and 81 APAs found intramembranous p.Val380Asp or p.Gly379Asp variants in two patients whose hypertension and periodic primary aldosteronism were cured by adrenalectomy. Replication identified two more APAs with each variant (total, n = 6). The most upregulated gene (10- to 25-fold) in human adrenocortical H295R cells transduced with the mutations (compared to wildtype) was CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), and biological rhythms were the most differentially expressed process. CADM1 knockdown or mutation inhibited gap junction (GJ)-permeable dye transfer. GJ blockade by Gap27 increased CYP11B2 similarly to CADM1 mutation. Human adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) expression of GJA1 (the main GJ protein) was patchy, and annular GJs (sequelae of GJ communication) were less prominent in CYP11B2-positive micronodules than adjacent ZG. Somatic mutations of CADM1 cause reversible hypertension and reveal a role for GJ communication in suppressing physiological aldosterone production.},

	abstract = {Driver somatic mutations for aldosterone excess have been found in ≈90\% of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) using an aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2)-guided sequencing approach. In the present study, we identified a novel somatic CACNA1H mutation (c.T4289C, p.I1430T) in an APA without any currently known aldosterone-driver mutations using CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry-guided whole exome sequencing. The CACNA1H gene encodes a voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel alpha-1H subunit. Germline variants in this gene are known as a cause of familial hyperaldosteronism IV. Targeted next-generation sequencing detected identical CACNA1H variants in 2 additional APAs in a cohort of the University of Michigan, resulting in a prevalence of 4\% (3/75) in APAs. We tested the functional effect of the variant on adrenal cell aldosterone production and CYP11B2 mRNA expression using the human adrenocortical HAC15 cell line with a doxycycline-inducible CACNA1HI1430T mutation. Doxycycline treatment increased CYP11B2 mRNA levels as well as aldosterone production, supporting a pathological role of the CACNA1H p.I1430T mutation on the development of primary aldosteronism. In conclusion, somatic CACNA1H mutation is a genetic cause of APAs. Although the prevalence of this mutation is low, this study will provide better understanding of molecular mechanism of inappropriate aldosterone production in APAs.},

Here we identified gain-of-function mutations in both CTNNB1 and GNA11 by whole-exome sequencing of 3/41 APAs. Further sequencing of known CTNNB1-mutant APAs led to a total of 16 of 27 (59\%) with a somatic p.Gln209His, p.Gln209Pro or p.Gln209Leu mutation of GNA11 or GNAQ. Solitary GNA11 mutations were found in hyperplastic zona glomerulosa adjacent to double-mutant APAs. Nine of ten patients in our UK/Irish cohort presented in puberty, pregnancy or menopause. Among multiple transcripts upregulated more than tenfold in double-mutant APAs was LHCGR, the receptor for luteinizing or pregnancy hormone (human chorionic gonadotropin). Transfections of adrenocortical cells demonstrated additive effects of GNA11 and CTNNB1 mutations on aldosterone secretion and expression of genes upregulated in double-mutant APAs. In adrenal cortex, GNA11/Q mutations appear clinically silent without a codriver mutation of CTNNB1.},

              Aldosterone producing adenomas (APAs) occur in the adrenal glands of around 30\% of patients with primary aldosteronism, the most common form of secondary hypertension. Somatic mutations in

              have been described in {\textasciitilde}60\% of these tumours. We subjected 15 aldosterone producing adenomas (13 with known mutations and two without) to RNA Sequencing and Whole Genome Sequencing (n = 2). All known mutations were detected in the RNA-Seq reads, and mutations in
              ATP2B3
              (G123R) and
              CACNA1D
              (S410L) were discovered in the tumours without known mutations. Adenomas with
              CTNNB1

          , 
            
              Endocrine tumors such as aldosterone-producing adrenal adenomas (APAs), a cause of severe hypertension, feature constitutive hormone production and unrestrained cell proliferation; the mechanisms linking these events are unknown. We identify two recurrent somatic mutations in and near the selectivity filter of the potassium (K
              +
              ) channel KCNJ5 that are present in 8 of 22 human APAs studied. Both produce increased sodium (Na
              +
              ) conductance and cell depolarization, which in adrenal glomerulosa cells produces calcium (Ca
              2+
              ) entry, the signal for aldosterone production and cell proliferation. Similarly, we identify an inherited
              KCNJ5
              mutation that produces increased Na
              +
              conductance in a Mendelian form of severe aldosteronism and massive bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. These findings explain pathogenesis in a subset of patients with severe hypertension and implicate loss of K

              channel selectivity in constitutive cell proliferation and hormone production.},
